## üõ†Ô∏è **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**

The **UNSW-NB15** dataset is a comprehensive network traffic dataset specifically created for evaluating **intrusion detection systems (IDS)**. Developed by the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS), it contains both **normal** and **malicious traffic**, making it an ideal resource for training and evaluating IDS models.

### üîë **Key Features of the UNSW-NB15 Dataset**

- **Diverse Attack Types**: Includes a wide range of **cyberattacks** such as **Denial of Service (DoS)**, **Analysis**, **Fuzzers**, and **Backdoor** attacks, among others. This diversity helps develop models that can generalize across different types of attacks.
  
- **Feature-Rich**: Contains **49 features**, including basic attributes such as **protocol type**, **service**, and more complex features like **packet statistics**, **flow behavior**, and **time-related characteristics**, allowing for a detailed analysis of network traffic.
  
- **Balanced Dataset**: The dataset includes both **normal traffic** and **malicious activity**, providing a balanced training set that helps improve model robustness and reduces bias towards malicious traffic.
